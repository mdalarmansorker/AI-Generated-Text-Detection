8/24/2023 21:35:04,"The epistemic uncertainty is the variability of the model output due to the randomness of the model itself. In the case of modeling ST data, this refers to the uncertainty (or confidence) of gene expression prediction given spatial location.","Epistemic uncertainty pertains to the variability in model output attributed to the inherent randomness within the model. In the context of modeling spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, this uncertainty relates to the confidence or uncertainty associated with predicting gene expression based on spatial location.","Epistemic uncertainty in ST data modeling refers to the uncertainty of gene expression prediction given spatial location.
